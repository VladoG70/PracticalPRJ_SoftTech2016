It plans to release a candidate recommendation for HTML5.1 by <b>June</b> and a full recommendation in <b>September</b>.</p>\r\n', '2016-05-22 10:13:37', 2),

The new edition provides a variety of new features, bugfixes and other improvements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to GitHub, the most notable new features include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Parallel fetches of submodules:</strong> “Using ‘git submodules,’ one Git repository can include other Git repositories as subdirectories. This can be a useful way to include libraries or other external dependencies into your main project. The top-level repository specifies which submodules it wants to include, and which version of each submodule,” wrote Jeff King, a Git team member, in a <a href="https://github.com/blog/2131-git-2-8-has-been-released">blog post</a>. According to him, if users have multiple submodules, fetches can be time-consuming. The latest release allows users to fetch from multiple submodules in parallel.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Don’t guess my identity: </strong>Instead of using one e-mail address for all of a user’s open-source projects, they can now tell Git what user name and e-mail they want to use before they commit.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Convergences with Git for Windows:</strong> The Git team has been working on making Git as easy to work with on Windows as it is on Linux and OS X. The latest release includes Git commands rewritten in C; Windows-specific changes from the Git for Windows project; and the ability to accept both LF and CRLF line endings. “This continuing effort will make it easier to keep the functionality of Git in sync across platforms as new features are added,” King wrote.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Security fixes: </strong>Git 2.8 addresses the vulnerability CVE-2016-2324. There have not been any reported exploits, but the vulnerability could execute arbitrary code when cloning a malicious repository, according to King.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Other features include the ability to turn off Git’s clean and smudge filters; the ability to see where a particular setting came from; the ability to easily diagnose end-of-line problems; the ability to see a remote repository’s default branch; and support for cloning via the rsync protocol has been dropped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The full release notes are available <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt">here</a>.</p>\r\n', '2016-01-17 11:27:50', 5),

According to the company, this is the first major release in four years. Zend Framework 3 features support for PHP 7, middleware runtime and performance enhancements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The newly released support for PHP 7 aims to simplify how developers create, debug, monitor and deploy modern Web and mobile apps in PHP 7. “This is an exciting time to be a PHP developer,” said Zeev Suraski, cofounder of Zend and CTO of Rogue Wave. “With Zend Framework 3, we’re continuing our quest to make creating PHP applications simpler, more accessible and faster.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, version 3 of the framework features an architectural structure that allows developers to use components within Zend Framework apps or any other framework in order to reduce dependencies, and to enable reuse within the PHP ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another key update to the solution is a new middleware runtime. Expressive is designed to focus on simplicity and interoperability, and it enables developers to customize their solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m extremely proud of the work we’ve done with Expressive,” said Matthew Weier O’Phinney, principal engineer and Zend Framework project lead at Rogue Wave. “Expressive signals the future of PHP applications, composed of layered, single-purpose PSR-7 middleware.”</p>\r\n', '2015-11-22 11:57:40', 5),

(11, 'MVC Framework - Introduction', 'What is MVC?\r\n\r\nThe Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application. MVC is one of the most frequently used industry-standard web development framework to create scalable and extensible projects.\r\nMVC Components\r\n\r\nModel: The Model component corresponds to all the data related logic that the user works with. This can represent either the data that is being transferred between the View and Controller components or any other business logic related data. For example, a Customer object will retrieve the customer information from the database, manipulate it and update it data back to the database or use it to render data.\r\n\r\nView: The View component is used for all the UI logic of the application. For example, the Customer view would include all the UI components such as text boxes, dropdowns, etc. that the final user interacts with.\r\n\r\nController: Controllers act as an interface between Model and View components to process all the business logic and incoming requests, manipulate data using the Model component and interact with the Views to render the final output. For example, the Customer controller would handle all the interactions and inputs from the Customer View and update the database using the Customer Model. The same controller would be used to view the Customer data.\r\nmodel_view_controller\r\nASP.NET MVC\r\n\r\nASP.NET supports three major development models: Web Pages, Web Forms and MVC (Model View Controller). The ASP.NET MVC framework is a lightweight, highly testable presentation framework that is integrated with existing ASP.NET features, such as master pages, authentication, etc. Within .NET, this framework is defined in the System.Web.Mvc assembly. The latest version of the MVC Framework is 5.0. We use Visual Studio to create ASP.NET MVC applications which can be added as template in Visual Studio.\r\nASP.NET MVC Features\r\n\r\nThe ASP.NET MVC provides the following features:\r\n\r\n    Ideal for developing complex but light weight applications\r\n    It provides an extensible and pluggable framework which can be easily replaced and customized. For example, if you do not wish to use the in-built Razor or ASPX View Engine, then you can use any other third-party view engines or even customize the existing ones.\r\n    Utilizes the component-based design of the application by logically dividing it into Model, View and Controller components. This enables the developers to manage the complexity of large-scale projects and work on individual components.\r\n    The MVC structure enhances the test-driven development and testability of the application since all the components can be designed interface-based and tested using mock objects. Hence the ASP.NET MVC Framework is ideal for projects with large team of web developers.\r\n    Supports all the existing vast ASP.NET functionalities such as Authorization and Authentication, Master Pages, Data Binding, User Controls, Memberships, ASP.NET Routing, etc.\r\n    It does not use the concept of View State (which is present in ASP.NET). This helps in building applications which are light-weight and gives full control to the developers.\r\n\r\nThus, you can consider MVC Framework as a major framework built on top of ASP.NET providing a large set of added functionality with focus on component-based development and testing.
