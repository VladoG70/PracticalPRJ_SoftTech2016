The new edition provides a variety of new features, bugfixes and other improvements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to GitHub, the most notable new features include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Parallel fetches of submodules:</strong> “Using ‘git submodules,’ one Git repository can include other Git repositories as subdirectories. This can be a useful way to include libraries or other external dependencies into your main project. The top-level repository specifies which submodules it wants to include, and which version of each submodule,” wrote Jeff King, a Git team member, in a <a href="https://github.com/blog/2131-git-2-8-has-been-released">blog post</a>. According to him, if users have multiple submodules, fetches can be time-consuming. The latest release allows users to fetch from multiple submodules in parallel.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Don’t guess my identity: </strong>Instead of using one e-mail address for all of a user’s open-source projects, they can now tell Git what user name and e-mail they want to use before they commit.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Convergences with Git for Windows:</strong> The Git team has been working on making Git as easy to work with on Windows as it is on Linux and OS X. The latest release includes Git commands rewritten in C; Windows-specific changes from the Git for Windows project; and the ability to accept both LF and CRLF line endings. “This continuing effort will make it easier to keep the functionality of Git in sync across platforms as new features are added,” King wrote.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Security fixes: </strong>Git 2.8 addresses the vulnerability CVE-2016-2324. There have not been any reported exploits, but the vulnerability could execute arbitrary code when cloning a malicious repository, according to King.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Other features include the ability to turn off Git’s clean and smudge filters; the ability to see where a particular setting came from; the ability to easily diagnose end-of-line problems; the ability to see a remote repository’s default branch; and support for cloning via the rsync protocol has been dropped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The full release notes are available <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt">here</a>.</p>\r\n', '2016-01-17 11:27:50', 5),

According to the company, this is the first major release in four years. Zend Framework 3 features support for PHP 7, middleware runtime and performance enhancements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The newly released support for PHP 7 aims to simplify how developers create, debug, monitor and deploy modern Web and mobile apps in PHP 7. “This is an exciting time to be a PHP developer,” said Zeev Suraski, cofounder of Zend and CTO of Rogue Wave. “With Zend Framework 3, we’re continuing our quest to make creating PHP applications simpler, more accessible and faster.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, version 3 of the framework features an architectural structure that allows developers to use components within Zend Framework apps or any other framework in order to reduce dependencies, and to enable reuse within the PHP ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another key update to the solution is a new middleware runtime. Expressive is designed to focus on simplicity and interoperability, and it enables developers to customize their solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m extremely proud of the work we’ve done with Expressive,” said Matthew Weier O’Phinney, principal engineer and Zend Framework project lead at Rogue Wave. “Expressive signals the future of PHP applications, composed of layered, single-purpose PSR-7 middleware.”</p>\r\n', '2015-11-22 11:57:40', 5),
(19, 'MVC Framework - Introduction', 'What is MVC?\r\n\r\nThe Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application. MVC is one of the most frequently used industry-standard web development framework to create scalable and extensible projects.\r\nMVC Components\r\n\r\nModel: The Model component corresponds to all the data related logic that the user works with. This can represent either the data that is being transferred between the View and Controller components or any other business logic related data. For example, a Customer object will retrieve the customer information from the database, manipulate it and update it data back to the database or use it to render data.\r\n\r\nView: The View component is used for all the UI logic of the application. For example, the Customer view would include all the UI components such as text boxes, dropdowns, etc. that the final user interacts with.\r\n\r\nController: Controllers act as an interface between Model and View components to process all the business logic and incoming requests, manipulate data using the Model component and interact with the Views to render the final output. For example, the Customer controller would handle all the interactions and inputs from the Customer View and update the database using the Customer Model. The same controller would be used to view the Customer data.\r\nmodel_view_controller\r\nASP.NET MVC\r\n\r\nASP.NET supports three major development models: Web Pages, Web Forms and MVC (Model View Controller). The ASP.NET MVC framework is a lightweight, highly testable presentation framework that is integrated with existing ASP.NET features, such as master pages, authentication, etc. Within .NET, this framework is defined in the System.Web.Mvc assembly. The latest version of the MVC Framework is 5.0. We use Visual Studio to create ASP.NET MVC applications which can be added as template in Visual Studio.\r\nASP.NET MVC Features\r\n\r\nThe ASP.NET MVC provides the following features:\r\n\r\n    Ideal for developing complex but light weight applications\r\n    It provides an extensible and pluggable framework which can be easily replaced and customized. For example, if you do not wish to use the in-built Razor or ASPX View Engine, then you can use any other third-party view engines or even customize the existing ones.\r\n    Utilizes the component-based design of the application by logically dividing it into Model, View and Controller components. This enables the developers to manage the complexity of large-scale projects and work on individual components.\r\n    The MVC structure enhances the test-driven development and testability of the application since all the components can be designed interface-based and tested using mock objects. Hence the ASP.NET MVC Framework is ideal for projects with large team of web developers.\r\n    Supports all the existing vast ASP.NET functionalities such as Authorization and Authentication, Master Pages, Data Binding, User Controls, Memberships, ASP.NET Routing, etc.\r\n    It does not use the concept of View State (which is present in ASP.NET). This helps in building applications which are light-weight and gives full control to the developers.\r\n\r\nThus, you can consider MVC Framework as a major framework built on top of ASP.NET providing a large set of added functionality with focus on component-based development and testing.

(20, 'LARAVEL Installation', 'Installation\r\n\r\nServer Requirements\r\n\r\nThe Laravel framework has a few system requirements. Of course, all of these requirements are satisfied by the Laravel Homestead virtual machine, so it''s highly recommended that you use Homestead as your local Laravel development environment.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you are not using Homestead, you will need to make sure your server meets the following requirements:\r\n\r\n    PHP >= 5.6.4\r\n    OpenSSL PHP Extension\r\n    PDO PHP Extension\r\n    Mbstring PHP Extension\r\n    Tokenizer PHP Extension\r\n\r\nInstalling Laravel\r\n\r\nLaravel utilizes Composer to manage its dependencies. So, before using Laravel, make sure you have Composer installed on your machine.\r\nVia Laravel Installer\r\n\r\nFirst, download the Laravel installer using Composer:\r\n\r\ncomposer global require "laravel/installer"\r\n\r\nMake sure to place the ~/.composer/vendor/bin directory (or the equivalent directory for your OS) in your $PATH so the laravel executable can be located by your system.\r\n\r\nOnce installed, the laravel new command will create a fresh Laravel installation in the directory you specify. For instance, laravel new blog will create a directory named blog containing a fresh Laravel installation with all of Laravel''s dependencies already installed:\r\n\r\nlaravel new blog\r\n\r\nVia Composer Create-Project\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you may also install Laravel by issuing the Composer create-project command in your terminal:\r\n\r\ncomposer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel blog\r\n\r\nLocal Development Server\r\n\r\nIf you have PHP installed locally and you would like to use PHP''s built-in development server to serve your application, you may use the serve Artisan command. This command will start a development server at http://localhost:8000:\r\n\r\nphp artisan serve\r\n\r\nOf course, more robust local development options are available via Homestead and Valet.\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\nPublic Directory\r\n\r\nAfter installing Laravel, you should configure your web server''s document / web root to be the public directory. The index.php in this directory serves as the front controller for all HTTP requests entering your application.\r\nConfiguration Files\r\n\r\nAll of the configuration files for the Laravel framework are stored in the config directory. Each option is documented, so feel free to look through the files and get familiar with the options available to you.\r\nDirectory Permissions\r\n\r\nAfter installing Laravel, you may need to configure some permissions. Directories within the storage and the bootstrap/cache directories should be writable by your web server or Laravel will not run. If you are using the Homestead virtual machine, these permissions should already be set.\r\nApplication Key\r\n\r\nThe next thing you should do after installing Laravel is set your application key to a random string. If you installed Laravel via Composer or the Laravel installer, this key has already been set for you by the php artisan key:generate command.\r\n\r\nTypically, this string should be 32 characters long. The key can be set in the .env environment file. If you have not renamed the .env.example file to .env, you should do that now. If the application key is not set, your user sessions and other encrypted data will not be secure!\r\nAdditional Configuration\r\n\r\nLaravel needs almost no other configuration out of the box. You are free to get started developing! However, you may wish to review the config/app.php file and its documentation. It contains several options such as timezone and locale that you may wish to change according to your application.\r\n\r\nYou may also want to configure a few additional components of Laravel, such as:\r\n\r\n    Cache\r\n    Database\r\n    Session\r\n\r\nOnce Laravel is installed, you should also configure your local environment.', '2016-08-31 22:31:38', 12),
(21, 'Easily deleting old soft-deleted records with Quicksand', 'When building applications, there are times when you would like to allow users to remove data from their view but keep the record in the database. An example could be allowing a user to delete their account, but you want to give them the opportunity to restart it later. If all their data is completely removed, then they would have to start completely over.\r\n\r\nLaravel’s Eloquent provides this ability out of the box, and when models are soft-deleted, they are not removed from the database. Instead, a deleted_at attribute is stored. The database record remains, and Eloquent ignores it unless explicitly told otherwise by a withTrashed attribute.\r\n\r\nOne problem with this is over time your soft-deleted records can fill up your database and take up a lot of space.\r\n\r\nTighten Co. recently released a new package called “Quicksand” which will help you solve this problem by automating and scheduling the deleting of old soft-deleted records.\r\n\r\nQuicksand is an Artisan command that you can run through the Laravel scheduler to force the deletion of your soft-deleted records. You can specify which classes you want to clean up, how long the records should remain, and it does the rest. Let’s take a look at this package.', '2016-08-31 22:37:15', 15),
(22, 'Променя ли програмирането начина ви на мислене?', '   Човешкият ум е многослоен и прекалено сложен, за да бъде описан и обсъден в едно кратко въведение, но всички можем да се съгласим, че нещата, които правим ежедневно ни въздействат малко или много. Едно от тях за хората от общността на SoftUni е програмирането – нещо, което става част от живота от на всички наши курсисти, а и остава част от него за всички, без значение дали продължават кариерното си развитие в тази насока.\r\n\r\nТова се дължи на редица промени, които програмирането прави с начина на мислене и изобщо възприемане на ежедневието на всеки един човек, който се е докоснал до света на софтуерната разработка. Това явление тепърва се изучава от модерната наука, но това не е от значение за мен, тъй като се намирам в сърцето на една жива, дишаща и бореща се с безчетни проблеми ежедневно общност.\r\n\r\nСлед едно своеволно малко проучване, желая да ви запозная с отговорите на нашите курсисти относно един много просто въпрос „Как програмирането промени начина ви на мислене?“\r\n\r\n\r\nРалица, 29 г. – стипендиант, Tech Module:\r\n\r\n„Програмирането направи мисленето ми по-алгоритмично – докато преди визуализирах проблемите си като списък от задачи, с които се заемах без да се замислям, днес нещата стоят различно. След като вече пиша програмен код ежедневно, започнах да подхождам към проблемите си различно – започнах да ги разбивам на части, справяйки се с всяка поотделно и да приоритизирам тяхното решение по-добре – точно както при разработката на софтуер.“\r\n\r\n\r\nБожидар, 19 г. – бивш курсист в СофтУни и част от екипа ни:\r\n\r\n„Начинът ми на мислене стана по-абстрактен – мога да си представям неясно дефинирани концепции по-лесно. Също така се научих да се адаптирам към различни ситуации много по-лесно, тъй като разработката на софтуер с различни езици и технологии ежедневно изисква това от теб. За добро или лошо също започнах да виждам проблемите в ежедневието си по-ясно.“\r\n\r\nДанчо, 22 г. – курсист и лектор в СофтУни:\r\n\r\nМога да кажа, че „програмисткият“ начин на мислене е бил нещо, с което мога да кажа, че съм живял от началото, то по-специфичното изучаване на програмирането ми даде способността да си поставям ясни цели и да се справям с тях. Не само това, но и практиката в разработката на софтуер ми позволи да оформя за себе си начин да решавам проблемите си с удоволствие и да гоня целите си с търпение и усилен труд.\r\n\r\nМария , 19 г. – графичен дизайнер и курсист в СофтУни\r\n\r\nКато едно от перфектните доказателства, че програмирането може да ви помогне в каквато и сфера да работите, Мария отговори следното:\r\n\r\n„Въпреки, че имам интерес към софтуерната разработка като кариерен път, в момента се занимавам с нещо привидно несвързано. Дори и така, всичко, което научих за програмирането ми помага най-вече за работата ми в графичния дизайн – използвам знанията си, за да разработвам различни автоматизации, плъгини и други способи за улесняване на работния процес с програми като Photoshop и After Effects.“\r\n\r\nНяма съмнение, че програмирането развива мисленето и го изменя по своеволен начин, който не познаваме добре още. Може да повярвате на всичко написано в тази статия, но можете да се уверите сами – запишете курса „Programming Basics” още днес и можете да получите най-цялостния поглед върху света на софтуерната разработка и да поставите първите си стъпки към кариерното развитие в сферата!\r\n\r\nКандидатстването за курса от отворено до 8-ми септември (включително), а самото обучение започва на 17-ти септември.', '2016-08-31 22:49:00', 16);
